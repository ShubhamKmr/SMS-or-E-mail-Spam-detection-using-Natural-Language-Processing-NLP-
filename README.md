This is Data analysis project which detects whether an SMS or E-mail is a spam or ham.I have used naive_bayes from sklearn library..I have also attached the dataset smsspamcollection.rar you can download it and execute the code.I have used two approach to solve the problem cleaning of data is done in both the process 1)Working out with CountVectorier , than using tfidf and finally passing is with naive_bayes.Multinomialnb() 2)directly passing the CountVectorier(),tfidfTransformer(),RandomForestClassifier() in sequence in the pipline.As it is Classification problem RFC can be used.Than carrying out the comparison of both the result.Refer the code for more details.. ;-D
